Steps: <br>
First, clone an existing repository, <br>
Second add the required files such as index.html, .css and other assets. <br>
Third, add new files to git, commit changes and then push. <br>
Forth, enable GitHub Pages then under Branch, select main then /root. <br>
Fifth, click save and lastly, access the live website   <br>
Takeaways: HTML and CSS are two of the most important parts in web programming<br>
because HTML handles the content of the webpage, while CSS handles the design <br> 
and layout of the website. I learned that it is important for me to learn both <br>
of them efficiently so that I can successfully be able to create a beautiful and <br>
flawless website.
